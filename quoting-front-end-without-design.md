# Quoting the front end of a project without Design assets

This happens to me a lot, especially with sub-zero, so i totally get the frustration. the
good news is that you just have to change the way you think about a quote in genral and recognize the opportunities you have without pre-existing design restrictions.

Let's think about the project for a sec. You're a good FE dev that knows her stuff, You can rock whatever layout comes at you, so forget visuals for now.

So down to business. If we're at this point in a project, we probably have enough information on content requirements that we can start making educated guesses about functionality.

This is a critical time to get with BE, Creative, and PM for a quick 30-60m or in ongoing Slack discussion. As soon as a project is discussed every single person in that room already has some sort of idea of how they want to approach it. Carousels? Video? Tabs? [insert thing here]?

You know how to do those things, and you probably know what technology you want to use for it, and how long it takes to get working. You have tangible numbers to play with... Pad them, because you know damn well requirements are going to change. Account for setup, account for testing, account for QA/feedback, etc., etc.

So what about design? Not yet. We can figure out the front end.

Are we going to use a framework? Are we rolling our own? You'll need a typography system, a spacing system, and a grid, right? Forms need styling. Are you doing anything to automate workflow? Do you need to set up a new development environment? Are there existing styles/markup you'll be using? Are there roadblocks in your environment you're already aware of? You know the answer to a lot of these things, and you can apply numbers to them. Pad these a bunch too.

Ok, so finally, let's talk about design. You may already see this in what I've described, but without the design, you have a TON of information to base numbers off of, and a lot of the padding you put into those numbers will bleed off into design/layout time naturally, Knowing that, I tend to just kind of think of layouts in general and know that i'll have pages with columns and grids and heroes and just kinda further layout, and then when that stuff is done, you'll have to make it look like something. I bet you can estimate how long a layout might take, roughly. Use those hours, and then dump a bunch of padding on top of that. Like almost double it. This accounts for all the caveats a design might bring on top of layout, and you have all the rights to put a big number on it because it's completely unknown.

So take all of those numbers, and think about time you'll spend pushing through QA and addressing client feedback, and add those to the pile. This should be right around your final numbers.

One other thing. Since you don't know about design. you have a super sweet opportunity to push ideas you've been looking to try out that you might not get to if design and functionality is already established through design. You furthermore get to do some research and pad in time to learn how to do said ideas, so definitely think about that.
